# British-Airways-Customer-Review-Analysis

Description:
I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize customer ratings for British Airways. This project aimed to provide comprehensive insights into passenger experiences across various aspects of the airline's service.

Key Features:

1. Global Rating Overview:
   - Implemented a world map visualization to display average overall ratings by country, allowing for geographical analysis of customer satisfaction.

2. Historical Trend Analysis:
   - Created a line graph showcasing the trend of overall ratings from 2016 to 2024, enabling the identification of long-term patterns and fluctuations in customer satisfaction.

3. Aircraft Performance Comparison:
   - Designed a bar graph to summarize average ratings by aircraft type, facilitating comparison between different models in the British Airways fleet.

4. Multi-dimensional Rating Metrics:
   - Developed individual metric displays for key service aspects:
     • Overall rating
     • Cabin staff service
     • Entertainment
     • Food and beverages
     • Ground service
     • Seat comfort
     • Value for money

5. Interactive Filtering:
   - Implemented dynamic filtering options allowing users to adjust the dashboard based on:
     • Traveler type (e.g., Business, Couple Leisure, Family Leisure)
     • Seat type (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class)
     • Aircraft group
     • Continent

6. Data Integration:
   - Utilized and merged two primary datasets:
     1. Reviews dataset: Containing detailed customer feedback and ratings
     2. Country dataset: Providing geographical classification for enhanced analysis

This dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to gain actionable insights into British Airways' customer satisfaction levels across different service areas, aircraft types, and geographical regions. It serves as a valuable tool for identifying areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement in the airline's overall customer experience.
